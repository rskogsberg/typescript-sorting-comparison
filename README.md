A project that helped me learn more about sorting algorithms, TypeScript, React (functional components, Context API (and Redux, even though I chose not to use it), custom hooks, etc), recursion, and asynchronous operations. My first big sticking point was getting the state management correct; before doing this project, I had some vague concept of what state and state management were, but getting through this sticking point taught me alot about how Context, Redux, and Recoil handle the flow of state between parent, children, and sbiling components. I chose Context over Redux because it seemd simpler (and required less boilerplate); however, in the future, I am going to look to use Redux with the new(ish?) Redux Toolkit. State was the biggest hurdle for me, but I also got stuck for a bit trying to handle the recursive Quicksort and Merge Sort correctly. I'm glad that I was able to incorporate custom hooks in this project, they really helped make everything easier. I also found TypeScript to be really great to work with after the initial learning curve; it really reduced debugging time for me. I'd like to improve this project in the future by adding new ways to sort the array (random, reversed, few discrete values, almost sorted), new algorithms, and potentially have two windows to allow simultaneous sorting.
